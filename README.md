## **1.   FoodClassification101**


#### **DataSet**
TensorFlow "*food101*" dataset are used in Model

#### **Model Detail**
In this model, I am able to achieve 77.49% overall accuracy on the full validation Data set with EfficientNetB0 base model

##### ***Different inferences***
1. On a similar dataset but with ResNet50 as a base model it gives maximum validation accuracy of 72%

2. On a similar dataset but with Xception as a base model it gives maximum validation accuracy of 54.76%
